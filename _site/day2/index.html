    <h1>Day 2 setting up and tweaks</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I got the the barebones working on 11ty which is a good step forward given my total procrastination and I guess, <em>fear</em> of starting anything new because I've been that long out of the game, it's all a bit <em>foggy</em>.</p>
<p>My first task this evening is to get some includes working. We set up the <code>_includes</code> folder yesterday and added that config to our <code>.eleventy.js</code> file so 11ty knows where to look when we want to include a <em>partial</em> or other chunk of repeatable code.</p>
<h2>includes</h2>
<p>I guess the easiest chunk to start with is our <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. This will be the same across all of our pages so I created a new file in my <code>_includes</code> folder called <code>_foot.html</code>.</p>
<p>This file can include anything, as long as it can be parsed. You can't fill the file with <code>php</code> and expect 11ty to work it all out and parse it correctly, but it will take <code>html</code> and the like.</p>
<p>So the footer is fairly basic. All it needs (if at all), is a copyright or string of text or whatever. Its more to signify the end of the page.  My <code>_foot.html</code> looks like this.</p>
<p><code>&lt;footer&gt;CroydonCreativ.es 2011-2020&lt;/footer&gt;</code></p>
<p>Simple and straight forward.</p>
<p>Now I've jumped back into my <code>_main.njk</code> template I built yesterday and I want to insert this footer at the end of the page. It'd normally nestle in just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>Here, instead of putting our footer tags &amp; end text, we'll include the <code>nunjucks</code> method of including our <code>_foot.html</code> partial</p>
<p>{% include &quot;_includes/_foot.html&quot; %}</p>
<p>Which will now insert our footer into each page which uses our <code>_main.njk</code> template.</p>
<p>I've done the same with my header so that is stored in it's own separate file too; just in case I want the same header across all pages but different layouts.</p>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>The main typeface used by CroydonCreativ.es is <strong>Adelle Bold</strong>. Adobe Fonts (formely TypeKit) serves this up as a webfont and gives me a css link to include in the head of my page.</p>
<p>I'd quite like all headings in Adelle. It's too much for body text though.</p>
<p>So my heading selector within my CSS will read like so:
<code>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {   font-family: &quot;adelle&quot;;   font-weight: 700; }</code></p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>Speaking of CSS, I've created a an <code>assets/css</code> and <code>assets/images</code> folder within my <code>_site</code> folder. I can store all of my css &amp; images in their respective folders to keep things clean.</p>
<p>Now when I last used CSS in anger, I was making the switch from <code>LESS</code> to <code>Sass</code>. I used to be a big <code>LESS</code> advocate; I even produced <a href="%22https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-less-video/9781783989867%22">a video course</a> with <a href="%22https://packtpub.com%22">Packt</a>. But <code>Sass</code> seemed to be advancing faster, and building in more features.</p>
<p>For the moment, I'll be using clean CSS whilst I try to catch up with more modern processes.</p>
<p>I've created a little colour palette, some header images, and roughly set my typefaces.</p>
<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>Quick day today. I've started a little list of things I want to roll in to the CroydonCreativ.es page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design that adapts to devices; it should be fairly easy with this site.</li>
<li>an email sign up <em>just in case</em> a 10yr anniversary thing does happens</li>
<li>responsive images for higher resolution screens</li>
<li>A CSS Reset. I previously used Meyers CSS reset but I'm sure there's better methods now.</li>
<li>New Layout &amp; CSS functions?</li>
<li>night &amp; day modes.</li>
</ul>
