#CroydonCreativ.es holding pages

The CroydonCreativ.es was a community in Croydon for web & creative folk to meet up away from screens. Have a drink, some food and banter.

It was a beautiful community.

But life got in the way and the CroydonCreativ.es went on hiatus.

And then at some point in 2020, it all fell over (what's new?) and the site stopped working... But to be fair, it was due an overhaul since 2016.

So here's something put together as a holding page maybe.
