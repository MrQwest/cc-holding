**CroydonCreativ.es** *was* a monthly social gathering for web folk and other creatives local to Croydon. It became a community of friends and contacts who would meet every month for food, drink & banter; but more so to get away from screens and to socialise with other like-minded people.

The community started in April 2011 and ran through to 2016 when time pressures got in the way and slowly, the monthly socials stopped and the **CroydonCreativ.es** community went on hiatus.

_Perhaps_ there'll be a revival to mark 10 years since the first one?
